\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The understanding of the thermalization process of gluons is key to find an appropriate description of the complex physical processes during RHICs.
		\item Using \alert{kinetic theory} and \alert{statistical transport equations} we can estimate important quantities such as the \alert{equilibration time} and understand the importance and differences of \alert{elastic and inelastic collisions}.
		\item The role of \alert{Bose-Einstein condensation} during the thermalization process 
		\item It is possible to find \alert{analytic solutions for a Nonlinear Boson Diffusion equation} providing further insights into the thermalization process.
